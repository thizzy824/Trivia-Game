## Unsolved problems

I was attempting to style the left/right borders of the game with iconic images of NFL players(4 per side) to add more life to the game but i couldn't get the image styling correct. The images would either not appear or they would throw off the styling of the game. In the end, left the game simple with 0 pics.

Did not get the high scores to display in the game/log the scores to local storage. Had to delete some code to preserve game functionality.

## Major Hurdles

No major hurdles with HTML

Properly aligning the display with CSS was the most challenging aspect. I spent the most time on CSS re-adjusting values to get the entire game to evenly display on screen. As mentioned above, adding images and properly sizing them was tough.

A major hurdle faced in the JavaScript was getting the questions I made to display in a random order while also not re-displaying a question that had been used already. I had to research a lot online but learned some cool syntax shortcuts like conditional ternary operators.
